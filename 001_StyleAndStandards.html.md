## Style and Standards

This guide explains the documentation requirements and provides guidelines to ensure your documentation follows the <a href="#StyleAndStandards">Style and Standards</a>.

It is important to follow these requirements and guidelines so that there is consistency throughout all of the documentation. The goal is to have all contributors write in the same way to ensure a uniform flow throughout the website. For example:<br><br>
<img src="img/DocGuidelinesOview.png" width="1400" height="400" alt="Consistency is key.">

These basic principals are explained in more detail in this guide, so read on for further information.

### Definition of done

The product is not done until the documentation is done. For instance, if you have a new service, feature, or solution to publish, you also need adequate documentation to release at the same time. This ensures readers fully understand the product and how to use it.

Review documentatoin before publishing to ensure the content meets the requirements and guidelines.

<a id="StyleAndStandards"></a>
### Style and standards

The Style and Standards topic describes the grammar and preferred word choices, and ensures that your content meets the requirements for publication. Because this guide relies on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Manual-Style-4th-Edition/dp/0735648719">Microsoft Manual of Style - 4th Edition</a> (MMoS), this page documents only those standards that are applied differently, or that the MMoS does not address. Search this page for any term to read about the standard.

  <p>colon (:) vs. semicolon (;)</p>
  </td>
  <td>
<p>Use colons and semicolons sparingly. Use the colon ( : ) to introduce a list of things. The items after a colon are not complete sentences by themselves. The semicolon ( ; ) separates two distinct clauses within one sentence. The phrase after a semicolon is a complete sentence.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If the sentence needs a colon but does not need a bulleted list, consider rewriting the sentence to avoid using a colon. </li>
				<li>If the sentence has a semicolon, try to separate it into two different sentences, or find a cleaner way to combine them into one sentence.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>See the examples for ways to write the same sentence with and without a colon or semicolon. The preferred method for such a sentence is without a colon or semicolon.</p>

  <td>
  <p>imperative mood</p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p>Use the imperative mood to write instructional documentation such as procedures and tutorials. The imperative mood tells the reader, directly, to do something. Other moods can imply optional behavior when you might not intend to present an action as optional. </p>
  <p>For example, in instructions for uploading documents, clicking <b>Upload</b> is not a suggested, optional action. If the document provides instructions for how to upload documents, assume the readers wants to perform that action. Do not use language such as, "If you want to upload a document, you can click <b>Upload</b>" or, "By clicking <b>Upload</b>, you can choose how many documents you want to upload." Instead write, "Click <b>Upload</b> and select one or more documents."</p>

#### Voice and tone

<p>
Voice and tone standards apply to the different types of documentation. First, it is important to understand the difference between voice and tone, and then follow the guidelines for writing content in the proper tone, depending on the destination for your documentation.
</p>

<h5>Difference between voice and tone</h5>

The difference between voice and tone can be a bit hard to differentiate at first. But think about the sound of your own voice, or a certain phrase that you use often. Those characteristics define your voice. When you address different people, or write documentation for different situations, you still have the same voice, but you might use a different tone. For instance, if you beat a friend in foosball, you might say, "I crushed you!" But if you beat your child at foosball, you might say, "Good game, kid."

<h5>Tones in technical documentation</h5>

There are different tones for the different types of technical documentation. The documentation can range from instructional to somewhat conversational, but always with the goal of helping users understand how to use the product for practical purposes and, in blogs and release notes, also helping business users understand changes so they can plan according to their business needs.
