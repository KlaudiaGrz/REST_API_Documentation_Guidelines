# REST API Documentation Guidelines

## Who cares about documentation?
The answer is we do. We care about your documentation. We are a team of technical writers and editors at SAP Hybris with a lot of experience documenting REST APIs and other solutions surrounding that topic. We came up with a way to ensure your docs are tops! We provide the following:

* Guidelines and requirements on how to properly document your project, located right here in the repository.
* Mentors that provide expert writing tips for non-native English writers, or anyone that needs a little help in the writing department, located on the [wiki](https://github.com/YaaS/REST_API_Documentation_Guidelines/wiki) tab.

## Get started
1. The best place to get your feet wet is to look at the [Table of Contents](001_Table_of_Contents.html.md#table-of-contents). It quickly outlines the different types of guidelines, and the requirements for certain documents. After a quick review of the [Definition of done](010_About_Style_And_Standards.html.md#definition-of-done), jump right in and learn best writing practices. For instance, write in active voice, present tense, and second person. The [Style and standards](010_About_Style_And_Standards.html.md#style-and-standards) section also guides you on topics such as how to effectively use certain terminology, and voice and tone.

2. Don’t worry about how to format your code, because the [Syntax Guidelines](020_Syntax_Guidelines.html.md) explains when to use bold font, and when to use code font, with plenty of examples. Also learn how to use popular technical writing techniques such as lists, tables, links, and images in your documentation.

3. The [REST API Documents](030_REST_API_Documents.html.md) section provides all the fine-grained details for what type of documents are required for your API, and why. This section also breaks down how to write a proper release note to keep users updated, but also how to use it to promote your product.

4. The [More Documentation](040_More_Documentation.html.md) section provides the guidelines for any other type of documentation, such as a Solution.
