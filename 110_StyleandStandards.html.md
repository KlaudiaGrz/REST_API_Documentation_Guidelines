The Style and Standards topic describes the grammar and preferred word choices, and ensures that your content meets the requirements for publication. Because this guide relies on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Manual-Style-4th-Edition/dp/0735648719">Microsoft Manual of Style - 4th Edition</a> (MMoS), this page documents only those standards that are applied differently, or that the MMoS does not address. Search this page for any term to read about the standard.
