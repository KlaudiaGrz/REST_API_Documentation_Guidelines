## More Documentation

### Solutions
Apart from APIs and tools, you can document solutions. The Solutions documentation includes details about extensibility, customization, and what functionality the user can unplug and replace with the user's own solutions.

Follow the [Style and Standards](010_About_Style_And_Standards.html.md#style-and-standards) for many agreed-upon standards.

#### Overview
In the first document, add a short introduction that explains the nature of your solution and what business value it brings to the reader. Add a list of features that the solution implements.

#### Details
This section describes the details of your solution in a logical order. For example, provide a Getting Started Guide, any integration instructions, and add a Troubleshooting section.

#### Example
For an example of unique solution documentation, see the <a href="https://devportal.yaas.io/solutions/saphybrisprofile/index.html">SAP Hybris Profile</a> documentation.
