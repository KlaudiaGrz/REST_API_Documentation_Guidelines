### Release notes 

Information in release notes must provide readers with everything they need to know to understand the change in the software. A lot of business decisions are made based on the information in release notes. Therefore, always write from the user's perspective, not the developer's perspective. The content of release notes answers the following questions:

* What changed because of this feature or resolved issue?
* How was the behavior different before this release?
* Are there changes to the UI?
* Are there changes to the functionality?
* Does an error message appear?
* Was the enhancement based upon customer feedback?

#### Prerequisites and requirements
Because the release notes contain critical information and act as an important communication tool, follow these guidelines so that the documentation is informative and consistent. When authoring release notes, follow the [Styles and Standards](001_Overview.html.md) for many agreed-upon standards, including word choices, use of acronyms, and product names.

##### Headlines
A headline is short, but interesting, and summarizes your release notes. Write headlines in sentence case.

##### Write about new features
When writing about new features, write an enticing paragraph instead of a short, bulleted list. This is an opportunity to market the new feature to customers from a business perspective.

##### Write about resolved issues
When writing about resolved issues, don't call them bugs. Use the term <i>resolved issues</i> because it has a more positive tone. A bulleted list of resolved issues is okay, but ensure that the descriptions make sense.

##### Bulleted lists
For ease of reading, use the same sentence structure throughout a bulleted list. For example, the following items match in sentence structure:
* Feature xyz - This one is really cool.
* Feature abc - This one is really, really, cool.</br>
**Don't add an entry that doesn't match, such as:**
* Feature JKL: it's not so cool

##### Version changes
For a new version of an existing service, such as a v2 or v3 release, make sure you include this information in your release note:

* The new version's benefits and features, including one or more examples of how to use it
* When the old service version becomes deprecated, and how long users have to migrate
* How to migrate to the new service version
* Where to find more information on the new service version, typically a link to the the new version documentation
